# Understanding What is .gitignore File: 


* gitignore file is basically a text file placed in your git repository that tells git not to track certain files and folders that you don't want being uploaded to your .git folder. 

* You can write the name of file or/and folder whichever you want to ignore in the gitignore file, and the file or/and folder will be ignored by git. 

* You can also ignore a specific type of files or/and folders by writing down specific patterns in your gitignore file. 

* But the only files or/and folders which will be ignored by git when typed inside gitignore file are those which are untracked. 

* Git ignores a blank folder by default, git does not show an empty folder as untracked because it is empty and there is nothing to track.
